# Notes SwiftUI

![Getting Started](./Images/Notes-Poster.jpg)

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind developing the NotesToDoc app was to replicate the user interface of the native iOS Notes application. This project was embarked upon as a means to delve deeper into the intricacies of UI development and to understand the underlying mechanics of how such an application operates. By recreating the Notes app, the project aims to offer profound insights into the design and functionality aspects, thereby sharpening the skills needed to craft intuitive and user-friendly applications.

## Features

The Notes app comes equipped with a suite of features designed to enhance the user experience and provide a seamless note-taking process. The core features of the application include:

1. Universal Compatibility: The app is designed to support both iPad and iPhone screens, ensuring a consistent and responsive user experience across all devices.
   
2. Mode Versatility: With support for Light and Dark modes, the app offers flexibility in appearance, allowing users to choose the theme that best suits their preference or ambient lighting conditions.
   
3. Persistent Data Storage: Utilizing Core Data, the app ensures that all notes are stored persistently. This means users can exit the app and return to find their notes exactly as they left them, ensuring data longevity and reliability.
   
4. Familiar User Interface: The UI of the NotesToDoc app closely mimics that of the native iOS notes app. This design choice provides users with a familiar environment, minimizing the learning curve and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Future Scope

While the Notes app already offers a robust note-taking solution, there are plans to further enhance its capabilities and integrate additional features. The future developments for the app include:

1. Integration of 'Sign in with Apple': To provide a more personalized and secure experience, there are plans to integrate 'Sign in with Apple'. This feature will not only enhance security but also pave the way for more personalized features in the future.
   
2. CloudKit Synchronization: In order to offer a seamless experience across different devices, the app aims to integrate CloudKit. This will allow users to synchronize their notes between different devices that are logged in with the same Apple ID, ensuring that their notes are always accessible, regardless of the device in use.
